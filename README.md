# Technical Report: Pneumonia Detection Image Classification
---

## Problem Statement:
---
The objective is to implement a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to classify whether patients have pneumonia or not based on x-ray images on their chest.WORK IN PROGRESS

## Data:
---
The dataset consist of x-ray images of patients' chest. The files can be found from [Mendeley](https://data.mendeley.com/datasets/rscbjbr9sj/2).
